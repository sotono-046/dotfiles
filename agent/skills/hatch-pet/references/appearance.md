# Sprite appearance and alpha boundaries

## Pet-Safe Styles

Default style is `auto`: infer the pet's style from the user's prompt and references, then preserve that style across every row. If the user names a style, honor it. Supported style presets include `pixel`, `plush`, `clay`, `sticker`, `flat-vector`, `3d-toy`, `painterly`, `brand-inspired`, and `auto`.

Any style is acceptable when it remains pet-safe:

- compact whole-body silhouette readable inside a `192x208` cell
- consistent face, proportions, material, palette, and props across all rows
- clean removable chroma-key background
- details large enough to read at pet size
- no text, labels, UI, or readable logos unless the user explicitly provides approved reference art and asks for them

Non-pixel styles are first-class. Plush, clay, sticker, vector, 3D toy, painterly mascot, ink, and brand-inspired looks should be accepted when they satisfy the atlas and readability constraints.

## Transparency And Effects

Pet rows are processed into transparent `192x208` cells, so every generated pixel must either belong to the pet sprite or be cleanly removable chroma-key background. Prefer pose, expression, and silhouette changes over decorative effects.

The deterministic raster pipeline owns the transparency and chroma-cleanup invariants. Its final edge-local spill-suppression step selects every translucent silhouette-boundary pixel plus opaque boundary pixels whose chroma points toward the known key, then extends clean interior RGB outward through that band in linear light. It preserves alpha exactly, clears hidden RGB under fully transparent pixels, and reports the algorithm and parameters used. The cleanup report plus atlas validator are authoritative for chroma contamination. Once the final report has `ok: true` and atlas validation passes, do not regenerate imagery or add another chroma-cleanup pass.

Fully transparent pixels are allowed outside the sprite silhouette, in unused cells, and in intentional negative-space openings that are part of the pet's design, such as loops or holes in a ribbon body. Reject any generated or repaired cell with accidental 100%-transparent holes inside a filled body, including horizontal bands, seam rows, scanline-like gaps, sliced-tile boundaries, or "see-through" interior stripes. Inspect suspect cells on a high-contrast background or alpha mask before accepting them; ordinary atlas validation is not enough when the hole is inside the silhouette.

Allowed effects must satisfy all of these conditions:

- The effect is state-relevant and helps explain the animation.
- The effect is physically attached to, touching, or overlapping the pet silhouette, not floating nearby.
- The effect is inside the same frame slot as the pet and does not create a separate sprite component.
- The effect is opaque, hard-edged enough for clean extraction, and uses non-chroma-key colors.
- The effect is small enough to remain readable at `192x208` without clutter.

Avoid these by default because they usually break transparent-background cleanup or component extraction:

- wave marks, motion arcs, speed lines, action streaks, afterimages, blur, or smears
- detached stars, loose sparkles, floating punctuation, floating icons, falling tear drops, separated smoke clouds, or loose dust
- cast shadows, contact shadows, drop shadows, oval floor shadows, floor patches, landing marks, impact bursts, glow, halo, aura, or soft transparent effects
- text, labels, frame numbers, visible grids, guide marks, speech bubbles, thought bubbles, UI panels, code snippets, checkerboard transparency, white backgrounds, black backgrounds, or scenery
- chroma-key-adjacent colors in the pet, prop, effects, highlights, or shadows
- stray pixels, disconnected outline bits, speckle/noise, cropped body parts, overlapping poses, or any pose that crosses into a neighboring frame slot

State-specific guidance:

- `idle`: keep this calm and low-distraction. Use only subtle breathing, a tiny blink, a slight head or body bob, a very small material sway, or another quiet persona-preserving motion. The loop must still contain visible micro-variation; do not accept six effectively identical copies. Do not show waving, walking, running, jumping, talking, working, reviewing, emotional reactions, large gestures, item interactions, or new props.
- `waving`: show the wave through paw, hand, wing, or limb pose only. Do not draw wave marks, motion arcs, lines, sparkles, symbols, or floating effects around the gesture.
- `jumping`: show vertical motion through body position only. Do not draw shadows, dust, landing marks, impact bursts, bounce pads, or floor cues.
- `failed`: tears, attached smoke puffs, or attached stars are allowed if they obey the allowed-effects rules; do not use red X marks, floating symbols, detached smoke, detached stars, or separate tear droplets.
- `waiting`: show that Codex needs approval, help, or user input through an expectant asking pose. Keep it distinct from ordinary idle and review.
- `running`: show active task work, processing, thinking, scanning, typing, or focused effort. Do not show literal foot-running, jogging, sprinting, treadmill motion, raised knees, long steps, pumping arms, directional travel, speed lines, dust clouds, floor shadows, motion trails, or detached motion effects.
- `review`: show focus through lean, blink, eyes, head tilt, or paw/hand position. Do not add magnifying glasses, papers, code, UI, punctuation, symbols, or other new props unless they already exist in the base pet identity.
- `running-right` and `running-left`: show directional drag movement through body, limb, and prop movement only. `running-right` must face and travel right; `running-left` must face and travel left. Their cadence must visibly alternate across the loop rather than repeating one nearly static stride. Do not draw speed lines, dust clouds, floor shadows, motion trails, or detached motion effects.
